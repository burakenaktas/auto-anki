# Auto Anki
Open source Anki (language flash card app) automation bot. You are setting words and meanings for Anki in a text file and bot is writing them down in it.

This bot is working with clicking relevant places on screen instead of you. 
What that means is you should set specific pixel locations for every single click to achieve actions.

## For Someone Who Is A Beginner

If you have already VS Code, Python, and Git on your computer and you can run apps with Python in VS Code, scroll to the <a href="https://github.com/aktasburaken/auto-anki#everyone"><strong>Everyone</strong></a> topic.

Firstly, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">download VS Code</a> on your computer.

Then, <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">download Python</a> too.

Finally, <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">download Git</a>.

<strong>If you get any errors except for auto anki code workflow errors, please search it on the internet. Otherwise, feel free to open an issue.</strong>


After you set up everything, open VS Code and it's terminal to clone the repo with this code: 

```
git clone https://github.com/aktasburaken/auto-anki.git
```


After that go inside of the cloned folder and for download needed libraries write this code:

For Windows:
```
py -3 -m pip install ftfy keyboard pyautogui
```
For Mac:
```
python3 -m pip install ftfy keyboard pyautogui
```

<strong>If you get any errors except for auto anki code workflow errors, please search it on the internet. Otherwise, feel free to open an issue.</strong>

Congratulations, you can keep going to everyone part now.

## Everyone

You should set a specific location for your Anki's adding card page and VS Code on your screen. After set these locations, ensure that they are not going to change next opening or you know where you should put them again.

There is config part in the code.

Before learning what are these configurations mean, we need to understand <strong>deck configs'</strong> variables with px (All of them ^^). Because you need to reassign these variables one by one according to your monitor and location of the both apps <strong>

### Finding Position

If you saw, there was a file named "position_finder.py" in our code. If you are setting your px configurations first time or again, use it to find declared button's x and y coordinates on your screen. You should open the file in your VS Code and then run the python code (showed below).

You should put your mouse on whatever you want in three seconds to get the certain x and y coordinates of that pixel. You can see the pixels on your terminal (showed below).

Let's say these coordinates were the coordinates for front_field_px variable. Then, you should write these coordinates with [x,y] format (showed below).

Don't forget that, if you don't want to change all deck config part of your code every single time before using <strong>Auto Anki</strong>, ensure you are preserving location of the both apps VS Code and Anki, also using same monitor.

## What do all configurations mean?

| Config      | Description       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| isMac  | If you are using mac, set this true.  |
| isGerman  | If your words are German, there are some specifications like coloring der, die, and das artikels.  |
| seperator | Which symbol is going to seperate your words, default " - ". You should set seperator with spaces if you don't want to see unneccessary spaces in your code. There is an example in word_file.txt file. |
